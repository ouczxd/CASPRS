Readme
https://github.com/ouczxd/CASPRS contains two versions of CASPRS: 1.3 and 2.1, now.
The Data named as "Haiyangimages..." is used for the CASPRS 1.3, and see detail in the paper "Using a transect-focused approach to interpret satellite images and analyze shoreline evolution in Haiyang Beach, China". See the file "CARPRS and Haiyang Beach.pdf".
The Data named as "Feng River sample.zip" is used for the CASPRS 2.1, and see detail in the paper "Using free satellite imagery to study the long-term evolution of intertidal bar systems", which is in review. The satellite images sample data are reduced to 11, since the original 812 images are too big to be uploaded to the GitHub. All the satellite images can be downloaded from Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/) using the program: "GEEdownloader" (https://github.com/ouczxd/CASPRS). 
The "ImageConverter ver1.0.py" is used to convert 16 bits images to 8 bits images, and the program also stretch the images according to the frequency of image intensity.
