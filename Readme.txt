https://github.com/ouczxd/CASPRS contains two versions of CASPRS: 1.3 and 2.1, now.
The CASPRS 1.3 and the sample data of Haiyang Beach is stored in the directory of "haiyang". See details in the paper "Using a transect-focused approach to interpret satellite images and analyze shoreline evolution in Haiyang Beach, China"(the file "CARPRS and Haiyang Beach.pdf").
and the CASPRS 2.1 and the sample data of Fenghe River mouth is stored in the directory of "fenghe". See details in the paper "Using free satellite imagery to study the long-term evolution of intertidal bar systems", which is in review. 
Only part of the satellite images were uploaded since all the images are too big to be uploaded to the GitHub. All the satellite images can be downloaded from Google Earth Engine (https://earthengine.google.com/) using the program: "GEEdownloader" (https://github.com/ouczxd/CASPRS).The "ImageConverter ver1.0.py"(https://github.com/ouczxd/CASPRS) is used to convert 16 bits images to 8 bits images, and the program also stretch the images according to the frequency of image intensity.
